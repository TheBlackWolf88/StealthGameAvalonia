# Stealth Game

A stealth-based strategy game where the player must reach the exit without being seen by patrolling guards.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

In this game, the player navigates through an `n x n` grid-based map filled with walls, floors, and patrolling guards. The objective is to reach the exit without entering a guardâ€™s line of sight. Guards move every 2 seconds and can see in a 5x5 area unless blocked by walls. The player moves one tile at a time using the `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys.

## ðŸŽ® Features

- Three distinct map sizes with unique layouts
- Player and guard movement with real-time visibility detection
- Dynamic patrol AI that changes direction on wall collision
- Pause menu with options to resume or start a new game
- Level selection menu on game start
- Visual representation using Avalonia UI with `UniformGrid`

## ðŸ§± Architecture

- **Model:** Core logic, including level representation (`Level`, `Board`, `Floor`, `Guard`, `Player`)
- **View:** Avalonia-based UI for rendering maps and handling input
- **Persistence:** Handles loading maps from default `Resources` or `%userprofile%\Documents\My Games\StealthGame\`

## ðŸ§ª Testing

Unit tests cover all major components:

- `LevelTest`: Validates map setup and coordinate logic
- `FloorTests`: Tests entity management on tiles
- `PlayerTests`: Validates player movement
- `GuardTests`: Validates guard movement and simulation

Tests are located in the `StealthGameTest` namespace.

## ðŸ“‚ Map Files

- User maps: `%userprofile%\Documents\My Games\StealthGame\`
- Maps contain layout, entity start positions, and exit location

## ðŸ›  Controls
